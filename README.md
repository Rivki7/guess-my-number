# Guess My Number Game
Made as part of JS course on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann.   
By doing this project I practiced manipulating the DOM. 
I added some more functionallity by adding levels to the game and also made it responsive for all screen sizes. 

## How to Play?
In this game you guess a number between 1 and 20. On each guess you can see wether the guess was too high or too low until you find the correct number. 

Enjoy! 

### 1. Choose level:

### 2. Start Guessing.  
Write a number in the box and click 'Check!'
Your guess might be too low or too high.
